<p>This our Story :
  We started as a small development team with one and only objectif to make it easier for business owners to control and manage their projects.
  Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints. This information is usually described in project documentation, created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints are scope, time, and budget.
  We grew to 30 projects with lots of plans and branches under each, which means 50 running builds at the same time.
  You can join us and be part of the adventure !</p>
